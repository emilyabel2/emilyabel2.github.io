        * Personal Background: Born and raised in West Springfield in Massachusetts, a city of about 30,000 people. Emily grew up caring for dogs, reading, playing video games, and playing sports (soccer, track & field, basketball, skiing, lacrosse, and cross country). Some things she is interested in learning about right now are cooking techniques/recipes, info about the dog I plan to get within a fear years (a samoyed), and the coding information I will need to develop a mobile game with my sister (an artist).
        * Professional Background: Emily's professional background includes working for the town of West Springfield, WestSpringfield Park, and for USOfficals as a soccer referee for several years before becoming a full time student.
        * Academic Background: Emily attended West Springfield High School, graduating in 2019. She now attends University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Some other schools she has attended over the years include St. Thomas the Apostle School, Fausey Elementary School, K12, and West Springfield Middle School.
        * Course Background: Emily's first experience with code was in senior year of high school in 2019 where took a AP Computer Science class which focused on java and covered the basics as well as polymorphisms and object oriented programming. That class spawned her desire to learn all the small details of coding, and doubled as experience tutoring several of her peers.
        * Primary Computer Platform: Emily's primary platform is a Windows 10 desktop (her current windows laptop is out of order due to hardware malfunction).
        * Courses she's taking and why (Spring 2022):
          * ITIS-3135-091 Web App Design and Development: Required class for a CS degree with a concentration in software development.
          * MATH-2164-010 Matrices & Linear Algebra: Required class for a BS in computer science.
          * CJUS-1100-003 Foundations of CJUS: Most interesting class that I could get registering for classes late as an elective.
          * ESCI-1101L-L11 Earth Science - Geography Lab: I've found earth science to be a simple yet interesting class and require a science lab to complete my degree.
        * Interetsing story to remember me by: "I love all dogs and would like to foster some day in the future, I also love the snow!"
