            <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
            Born and raised in West Springfield in Massachusetts, a city of
            about 30,000 people. Emily grew up caring for dogs, reading, playing
            video games, and playing sports (soccer, track & field, basketball,
            skiing, lacrosse, and cross country). Some things she is interested
            in learning about right now are cooking techniques/recipes, info
            about the dog I plan to get within a fear years (a samoyed), and the
            coding information I will need to develop a mobile game with my
            sister (an artist).

            <strong>Course Background:</strong>
            Emily's first experience with code was in senior year of high school
            in 2019 where took a AP Computer Science class which focused on java
            and covered the basics as well as polymorphisms and object oriented
            programming. That class spawned her desire to learn all the small
            details of coding, and doubled as experience tutoring several of her
            peers.
