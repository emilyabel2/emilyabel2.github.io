            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>
            Born and raised in West Springfield Massachusetts, a city of
            about 30,000 people. Emily grew up caring for dogs, reading, playing
            video games, and playing sports (soccer, track & field, basketball,
            skiing, lacrosse, and cross country). Some things she is interested
            in learning about right now are cooking techniques/recipes, info
            about the dog I plan to get within a fear years (a samoyed), and the
            coding information I will need to develop a mobile game with my
            sister (an artist).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Background:</strong>
            Emily's professional background includes working for the town of
            West Springfield, WestSpringfield Park, and for USOfficals as a
            soccer referee for several years before becoming a full time
            student.
          </li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>
            Emily attended West Springfield High School, graduating in 2019. She
            now attends University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Some other
            schools she has attended over the years include St. Thomas the
            Apostle School, Fausey Elementary School, K12, and West Springfield
            Middle School.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Course Background:</strong>
            Emily's first experience with code was in senior year of high school
            in 2019 where took a AP Computer Science class which focused on java
            and covered the basics as well as polymorphisms and object oriented
            programming. That class spawned her desire to learn all the small
            details of coding, and doubled as experience tutoring several of her
            peers.
